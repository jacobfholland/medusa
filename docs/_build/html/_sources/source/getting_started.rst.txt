Medusa
======

Medusa is a powerful Python framework designed to simplify and accelerate your web application development. It offers modular database usage and web routing functionality, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of Python applications. With Medusa, you can hit the ground running, eliminating the need for extensive prerequisite setup and enabling you to focus on building your application.

Two Main Components: Database and Server
----------------------------------------

Medusa consists of two powerful main components: the **Database** and the **Server**. These components can be used independently to cater to your specific project needs or seamlessly combined to create a comprehensive web application.

Database
^^^^^^^^

The **Database** component is responsible for managing all database-related operations and functionality. It simplifies the process of working with databases by offering the following features:

- **Data Models**: Define your data models effortlessly using Python classes. Medusa automates the generation of database tables based on these models.

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on your data models with ease. Medusa streamlines database interactions, reducing boilerplate code.

- **Modular and Extensible**: The Database component is designed to be modular and extensible. You can add custom data models and extend functionality as your project demands.

Server
^^^^^^

The **Server** component handles all aspects related to API endpoints and web server functionality. It simplifies the process of setting up and managing web routes and is packed with features:

- **Web Routing**: Define API endpoints, web pages, and routes with minimal effort. Medusa's Server component makes it easy to structure your web application.

- **Cross-functionality**: Used in combination with the Database component, the Server component auto-generates base-level Model endpoints, simplifying common operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for your data models. This automation reduces repetitive code and speeds up your development process.

- **Modular Design**: The Server component follows a modular design, allowing you to add, remove, or override routes as needed. This makes it easy to adapt your application to changing requirements.

Easy to Use

Mix and Match
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the key advantages of Medusa is its flexibility. You can use the Database and Server components individually or together, depending on your project's needs. Whether you're building a database-driven application, a RESTful API, or a dynamic web application, Medusa has you covered.

Easy Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Medusa provides a simple way to configure and control these components using environment variables. Check out the `Environment Variables <environment_variables>`_ section to learn more about how to customize and fine-tune your Medusa environment.
